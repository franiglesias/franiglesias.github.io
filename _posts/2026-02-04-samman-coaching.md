Buscando katas para un curso, encontré esta web de la Samman Technical Coaching Society. Es un recurso muy valioso para cualquier persona que se dedique de una forma u otra a la formación técnica, ya sea dentro de equipos de empresas, en coding-dojos, etc.

> Technical coaches work with software development teams to help them adopt better coding practices. The Samman method
is a concrete approach that many technical coaches use. This website is designed to help people who do technical
coaching and is maintained by the Samman Technical Coaching Society. This site shares materials you can use for Code
Katas and Learning Hours, as well as many supporting materials. We also have official Training courses.
