Hi, I'm Fran Iglesias. I'm a Senior Software Developer from Spain. I'm very interested in software design and agile technical practices.

## Contact me

I'm always open to a good conversation about programming, software design or whatever. So, don't hesitate to drop an email.

Also, I will be more than happy if you think I can help with some free mentoring. Specially, if you have found some difficult to get help in your current personal situation or belong to an under-represented community.

## Employers and collaborations

This site was created for my own opinions and contents, with occasional collaborators. 

On the other hand, the site is not sponsored or endorsed by any company or organization. It is completely ad free and I don't have plans to monetize it, [apart from selling some books of mu own](https://leanpub.com/u/franiglesias).  

Anyway, the contents could be influenced by my context during the time I wrote and published them. I'm sharing here the list of companies I've been working for and other organizations, so you can gain some knowledge about that context.
