Hello, my name is Fran Iglesias. I am a Senior Software Developer based in Spain, with a strong focus on software design and agile technical practices.

## Contact

I am always open to engaging discussions about programming, software design, or related topics. Please feel free to contact me via email.

Additionally, I am happy to offer free mentoring, particularly to those who may face challenges accessing support due to their personal circumstances or who belong to underrepresented communities.
